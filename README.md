# Customer Rewards Site

This customer account website allows customers, if they are eligible for rewards, to see which rewards are available to them, depending on their channel subscriptions. It features implementation of a Rewards Service and a mock-up version of an Eligibilty Service interface.

## Installation
If you would like to view this web application on your local machine please follow these steps, after cloning the project down from the GitHub website.

* I built this project using node v14.15.4.

1. Navigate into ```rewards-service``` (from ```customer-rewards-site```)
2. Run ```npm install``` to install all dependencies
3. Run ```npm start``` to start the React app on https://localhost:3000 and navigate to the page on your browser.

I hope you enjoy the project.

## Tests
To run the tests I have written for the project run;

1. ```npm run test-utils``` for the util functions
2. ```npm run test-eligibility-service``` for the mock eligibilty service function
